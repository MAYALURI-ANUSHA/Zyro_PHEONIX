I am delighted to submit my final entry for the Zyro Hackathon’s AI ML Image Classifying Challenge. Leveraging PyTorch, I have successfully built a Convolutional Neural Network with a meticulous design that ensures high accuracy, surpassing the minimum requirement of 65 percent, and remarkably keeping the trainable parameters under 2 million. Additionally, I took on the bonus challenge by deploying the model using Flask, creating an interactive web interface for users to effortlessly upload images and receive real-time classifications. The web page is designed for simplicity and functionality, aligning with the competition's criteria of evaluating both accuracy and model lightness. This achievement reflects my commitment to efficiency and innovation in deep learning. The entire project was developed in Google Colab, ensuring accessibility, and the notebook is thoroughly documented with comments for clarity and collaboration.

Highlights of our project is are:

	Very  smaller number of parameters . i.e., 39514

 


	 Industry acceptable range accuracy. i.e., 70.39%

 


	Very User-Friendly Web Page

 

	 Summary of the model

 

	 Model Architecture
 

****THANK YOU****
