**AI ML Problem Statement : IMAGE CLASSIFYING CHALLENGE**

We intend you to build a Machine Learning model capable of image classification on a 
provided dataset of images. These images are already classified into ten groups based on the 
content of the pictures. Your "model" must predict the content of the images with an accepted 
level of accuracy.
Buzzwords aside, what we mean by a model is a group of neurons capable of classifying images. 
One of the best ways to do this would be to use a Convolutional neural network.

I am delighted to submit my final entry for the Zyro Hackathon’s AI ML Image Classifying Challenge. Leveraging PyTorch, I have successfully built a Convolutional Neural Network with a meticulous design that ensures high accuracy, surpassing the minimum requirement of 65 percent, and remarkably keeping the trainable parameters under 2 million. Additionally, I took on the bonus challenge by deploying the model using Flask, creating an interactive web interface for users to effortlessly upload images and receive real-time classifications. The web page is designed for simplicity and functionality, aligning with the competition's criteria of evaluating both accuracy and model lightness. This achievement reflects my commitment to efficiency and innovation in deep learning. The entire project was developed in Google Colab, ensuring accessibility, and the notebook is thoroughly documented with comments for clarity and collaboration.

Highlights of our project is are:

	Very  smaller number of parameters . i.e., 39514

	 Industry acceptable range accuracy. i.e., 70.39%
